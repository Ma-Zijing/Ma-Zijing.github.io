# RFID-based and few-shot gesture recognition system.
- [TMC 2022] "RF-Siamese: Approaching Accurate RFID Gesture Recognition With One Sample", Zijing Ma, Shigeng Zhang, Jia Liu, Xuan Liu, Weiping Wang, Jianxin Wang, Song Guo.
  
Existing sensing systems usually require collecting a large number of samples to train a classifier for every environment, or further assume similar sample distribution between different environments such that a model trained in one environment can be transferred to another. In this paper, we propose RF-Siamese, an RFID-based gesture sensing approach that achieves comparable accuracy to existing solutions but requires only a few samples in each eivironment. RF-Siamese achieves a high accuracy of 0.93 with only one sample of each gesture when recognizing 18 different gestures.
