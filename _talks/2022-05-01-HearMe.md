# RFID-based and real-time lip movement recognition system.
- [TMC 2022] "Hearme: Accurate and real-time lip reading based on commercial rfid devices", Shigeng Zhang, Zijing Ma, Kaixuan Lu, Xuan Liu, Jia Liu, Song Guo, Albert Y Zomaya, Jian Zhang, Jianxin Wang

In this project, we design and implement HearMe, an accurate and real-time lip-reading system built on commercial RFID devices. HearMe can be used to accurately recognize different words in a pre-defined vocabulary without limitations in light conditions and can be used in multiple user scenarios by leveraging RFIDâ€™s ability in identifying different users. Experimental results show that HearMe detects speaking actions of the user with an accuracy higher than 0.95 and recognizes different words in a 20-words vocabulary with an average accuracy higher than 0.88.
