## RFID-based and real-time gesture recognition system.
- [TMC 2022] "Real-time and Accurate Gesture Recognition with Commercial RFID Devices", Shigeng Zhang, Zijing Ma, Chengwei Yang, Xiaoyan Kui, Xuan Liu, Weiping Wang, Jianxin Wang, Song Guo

Most existing RFID-based gesture recognition approaches use signal profile matching to distinguish different gestures, which incur
large recognition latency and fail to support real-time applications. We proposed ReActor, a real-time and accurate gesture recognition system that recognizes a userâ€™s gestures with low latency and high accuracy. ReActor combines the time-domain statistical features and the frequency-domain features to precisely represent the signal profile corresponding to different gestures. ReActor achieves an average accuracy of 97.2% in recognizing 18 different gestures with an average latency of 72 ms, more than two orders of magnitude faster than approaches based on profile template matching.
