## RFID-based and few-shot gesture recognition system.
- [TMC 2022] "RF-Siamese: Approaching Accurate RFID Gesture Recognition With One Sample", Zijing Ma, Shigeng Zhang, Jia Liu, Xuan Liu, Weiping Wang, Jianxin Wang, Song Guo.
  
Existing sensing systems usually require collecting a large number of samples to train a classifier for every environment, or further assume similar sample distribution between different environments such that a model trained in one environment can be transferred to another. In this paper, we propose RF-Siamese, an RFID-based gesture sensing approach that achieves comparable accuracy to existing solutions but requires only a few samples in each eivironment. RF-Siamese achieves a high accuracy of 0.93 with only one sample of each gesture when recognizing 18 different gestures.

## RFID-based and real-time gesture recognition system.
- [TMC 2022] "Real-time and Accurate Gesture Recognition with Commercial RFID Devices", Shigeng Zhang, Zijing Ma, Chengwei Yang, Xiaoyan Kui, Xuan Liu, Weiping Wang, Jianxin Wang, Song Guo

Most existing RFID-based gesture recognition approaches use signal profile matching to distinguish different gestures, which incur
large recognition latency and fail to support real-time applications. We proposed ReActor, a real-time and accurate gesture recognition system that recognizes a user’s gestures with low latency and high accuracy. ReActor combines the time-domain statistical features and the frequency-domain features to precisely represent the signal profile corresponding to different gestures. ReActor achieves an average accuracy of 97.2% in recognizing 18 different gestures with an average latency of 72 ms, more than two orders of magnitude faster than approaches based on profile template matching.

## RFID-based and real-time lip movement recognition system.
- [TMC 2022] "Hearme: Accurate and real-time lip reading based on commercial rfid devices", Shigeng Zhang, Zijing Ma, Kaixuan Lu, Xuan Liu, Jia Liu, Song Guo, Albert Y Zomaya, Jian Zhang, Jianxin Wang

In this project, we design and implement HearMe, an accurate and real-time lip-reading system built on commercial RFID devices. HearMe can be used to accurately recognize different words in a pre-defined vocabulary without limitations in light conditions and can be used in multiple user scenarios by leveraging RFID’s ability in identifying different users. Experimental results show that HearMe detects speaking actions of the user with an accuracy higher than 0.95 and recognizes different words in a 20-words vocabulary with an average accuracy higher than 0.88.
