[//]: # (## Bio)

My name is Zijing Ma (马子靖). I am currently a first-year PhD student at The Hong Kong Polytechinic University (PolyU),
under the supervision of Professor [Yuanqing Zheng](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csyqzheng/). 
I received my Master's degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at 
Central South University (CSU), under the guidance of 
Professor [Shigeng Zhang](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/zhangshigeng/en/index.htm). 
Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in 2020 at South China Agricultural University (SCAU),
where I was mentored by Associate Professor Shuangjuan Li.
