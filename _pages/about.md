## Bio
<!-- I am currently a big data development engineer in China Unicom Software Research Institute. I received my master degree at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Central South University (CSU), advised by Professor [Shigeng Zhang](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/zhangshigeng/en/index.htm). I received my bachlor degree in 2020 from South China Agricultural University (SCAU), where I was advised by Associate Professor Shuangjuan Li. -->

My name is Zijing Ma (马子靖). I am currently working as a Big Data Development Engineer at China Unicom Software Research Institute. I earned my Master's degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Central South University (CSU), under the guidance of Professor [Shigeng Zhang](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/zhangshigeng/en/index.htm). Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in 2020 at South China Agricultural University (SCAU), where I was mentored by Associate Professor Shuangjuan Li.
